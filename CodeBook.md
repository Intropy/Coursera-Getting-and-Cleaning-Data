This data set contains the results of experiments carried out by 30 volunteers performing six activities with a cell phone on the waist for the purpose of capturing data on linear and rotational motion.

The raw data used are available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data set is produced from the raw by combining the train and test sets, applying semantically meaningful feature names to the data, retaining only "mean" and "std" (standard deviation) data, merging subject id and activity with the observations, and summarizing the multiple observations in each subject/activity pair by the mean values.
